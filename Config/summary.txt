Hi! I am a self-sufficient, resourceful and hard working team member who often leads by example. 
I have a strong passion for visual storytelling and pushing the boundaries of multimedia technologies to develop new ways to create and accentuate narratives.
My work relies heavily on memories, feelings and emotions navigating through life.
In general, I'm very interested in the pipelines of film, animation, 3D modeling and VFX.
